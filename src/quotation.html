This page collects some quotations that I like. It is updated from time to time. I try to clarify the source of each quotation. Before starting, remember that <span class="dotunder">you never need quotations to justify your belief if you have one, and it is never a good idea to believe in something merely because some celebrity said so</span> (and it will be even worse if it turns out that she/he actually did not).

<dt>Cum enim mundi universi fabrica sit perfectissima atque a Creatore sapientissimo absoluta, nihil omnino in mundo contingit, in quo non maximi minimive ratio quaepiam eluceat; quamobrem dubium prorsus est nullum, quin omnes mundi effectus ex causis finalibus ope methodi maximorum &amp; minimorum aeque feliciter determinari queant, atque ex ipsis causis efficientibus. (For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect, and is the work of a most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever takes place in the universe in which some relation of maximum and minimum does not appear. Wherefore there is absolutely no doubt that every effect in the universe can be explained as satisfactorily from final causes, by the aid of the method of maxima and minima, as it can from the effective causes themselves.)</dt>

<dt>A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.</dt>
<dd><p>
<br /> &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfr%C3%A9d_R%C3%A9nyi">Alfréd Rényi</a>
<br /> This remark, generally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a>, was probably made by Alfréd Rényi. 
In <a href="https://plus.google.com/110050584459359486755">Bruce Schechter</a>'s biography of Erdős, <i><a href="https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/My_Brain_is_Open.html?id=_GsQiXvfNWkC&amp;redir_esc=y">My Brain is Open: The Mathematical Journeys of Paul Erdős</a></i> (Simon and Schuster, 1998), <a href="https://goo.gl/Gimxso">page 155</a> reads:
&ldquo;Rényi would become one of Erdős's most important collaborators &hellip; Their long collaborative sessions were often fueled by endless cups of strong coffee. Caffeine is the drug of choice for most of the world's mathematicians and coffee is the preferred delivery system. Rényi, undoubtedly wired on espresso, summed this up in a famous remark almost always attributed to Erdős: &lsquo;A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.&rsquo; &hellip; <span class="dotunder">Turán (<a href="https://goo.gl/XVcpRW">Pál Turán</a>), after scornfully drinking a cup of American coffee, invented the corollary: &lsquo;Weak coffee is only fit for lemmas.</span>&rsquo;&rdquo; Similar attribution is given in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacTutor_History_of_Mathematics_archive">MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive</a>: <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html">Alfréd Rényi</a></i>, where it is written that &ldquo;Known to his many friends and colleagues by the nickname of 'Buba&rsquo;, he (Rényi) often remembered as the author of the anecdote: &hellip; a mathematician is a machine for converting coffee into theorems. Turán developed the anecdote further by describing weak coffee as fit only for lemmas.&rdquo; Additionally, in <a href="http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-networks6">Section 6</a> (The Erdős graph) of the essay &ldquo;Complex Networks&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcbrowse?year=2004">Feature Column from the AMS, April 2004</a>), <a href="http://www.york.cuny.edu/~malk/">Joseph Malkevitch</a> writes: &ldquo;Erdős has often been associated with the observation that &lsquo;a mathematician is a machine for converting coffee into theorems&rsquo; but this &lsquo;characterization&rsquo; appears to be due to his friend, Alfred Rényi. This thought was developed further by Erdős&rsquo; friend the Hungarian mathematician Paul Turán (1910&ndash;1976), who suggested that weak coffee was suitable &lsquo;only for lemmas&rsquo;.&rdquo; 



<br /> However, it is also suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German: &ldquo;Ein Mathematiker ist eine Maschine, die Kaffee in Sätze verwandelt&rdquo;, where it can be interpreted as a wordplay on the double meaning of the word &ldquo;<a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/satz">Satz</a>&rdquo;, which can mean both &ldquo;theorem&rdquo; and &ldquo;coffee grounds&rdquo; (&ldquo;Sätze&rdquo; is its plural form).

<dt>The true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be in a reasonable man's mind). This branch of Math., which is generally thought to favour gambling, dicing, and wagering, and therefore highly immoral, is the only &lsquo;Mathematics for Practical Men&rsquo;, as we ought to be.</dt>
<dd><p>
<br /> &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell">James C. Maxwell</a> 
<br /> This quotation comes from &ldquo;Letter to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Campbell_(classicist)">Lewis Campbell</a>, c. July 1850&rdquo;, <a href="http://books.google.fr/books/about/The_Scientific_Letters_and_Papers_of_Jam.html?id=zfM8AAAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y"><i>The Scientific Letters and Papers of James Clerk Maxwell: 1846&ndash;1862</i></a>, edited by Peter M. Harman, CUP Archive, 1990 (<a href="http://goo.gl/AkFGIo">page 197</a>).
It was written in this letter that &ldquo;As it is Saturday night I will not write very much more. I was thinking today of the duties of [the] cognitive faculty. It is universally admitted that duties are voluntary, and that the will governs understanding by giving or withholding Attention. They say that Understanding ought to work by the rules of right reason. These rules are, or ought to be, contained in Logic; but the actual science of Logic is conversant at present on with things either certain, impossible, or <i>entirely</i> doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be in a reasonable man's mind). This branch of Math., which is generally thought to favour gambling, dicing, and wagering, and therefore highly immoral, is the only &lsquo;Mathematics for Practical Men&rsquo;, as we ought to be. Now, as human knowledge comes by the senses in such a way that the existence of things external is on inferred from the harmonious (not similar) testimony of the different senses, Understanding, acting by the laws of right reasoning, will assign to different truths (or facts, or testimonies, or what shall I call them) different degrees of probability.&rdquo;</p></dd>

<br /> &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Truesdell">Clifford A. Truesdell</a>
<br /> In the very beginning of Chapter III (Thermodynamics of visco-elasticity, page 35) of <a href="http://goo.gl/rxAnQU"><i>Six Lectures on Modern Natural Philosophy</i></a> (Springer-Verlag, 1966), Truesdell's comment on thermodynamics is: &ldquo;Thermostatics, which even now is usually called thermodynamics, has an unfortunate history and a cancerous tradition. It arose in a chaos of metaphysical and indeed irrational controversy, the traces of which drip their poison even today &hellip; The logical standards acceptable in thermostatics fail to meet the criteria of other exact sciences; in books and papers concerning it the proportion of words if not <span class="dotunder">prayers</span> to equations is high &mdash; to proved theorems, <span class="dotunder">almost infinite</span>. There is nothing that can be said by mathematical symbols and relations which cannot also be said by words. The converse, however, is false.

This quotation comes from &ldquo;The Role of Mathematics in the Sciences and in Society&rdquo;, Address at 4th Conference of Association of Princeton, Graduate Alumni, June 1954, pp. 16-29, [Vol. VI, No. 34],
included in

Taub</a>, Pergamon Press, 1963. The quotation appears on <a href="https://goo.gl/rkvDH6">page 489</a> of the book, where it reads: &ldquo;But still a large part of mathematics which becomes useful developed with absolutely no desire to be useful, and in a situation where nobody could possibly know in what area it would become useful; and there were no general indications that it ever would be so. By and large it is uniformly true in mathematics that there is a time lapse between a mathematical discovery and the moment when it is useful; and that this lapse of time can be anything from thirty to a hundred years, in some cases even more; and that the whole system seems to function without any direction, without any reference to usefulness, and without any desire to do things which are useful.&rdquo; 
<br /> These sentences are quoted by <a href="http://www.uiginn.com/maths/staff/thurley.shtml">Ted Hurley</a>, &ldquo;Algebraic structures for communications&rdquo;, in <a href="http://faculty.evansville.edu/rm43/">Robert F.

&ldquo;Indeed it took over 200 years for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)"><i>Field Theory</i></a> to become &lsquo;useful&rsquo; and this theory is now fundamental within the communications&rsquo; areas.

<br /> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a><br /> 
In &ldquo;Method in the physical sciences&rdquo; (published in <i>The Unity of Knowledge</i>, ed. L. Leary (1955), pp. 157-164; and also
<i>John von Neumann Collected Works</i>, ed. A. Taub, Vol. VI, pp. 491-498.), von Neumann wrote:
&ldquo;Thus whether one chooses to say that classical mechanics is causal or
teleological is purely a matter of literary inclination at the moment of
talking. This is very important, since it proves, that if one has really
technically penetrated a subject, things that previously seemed in
complete contrast, might be purely mathematical transformations of each
other. Things which appear to represent deep differences of principle and
of interpretation, in this way may turn out not to affect any significant
statements and any predictions. They mean nothing to the content of the
theory.&rdquo;

<br /> Similar comments appear in Richard W. Hamming, <a href="https://goo.gl/bQDpH9"><i>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn</i></a>, CRC Press, 2003 (Chapter 4, pages 27&ndash;28): 
&ldquo;History tends to be charitable in this matter. It gives credit for understanding what something means when we first to do it. But there is a wise saying, &lsquo;Almost everyone who opens up a new field does not really understand it the way the followers do.&rsquo; The evidence for this is, unfortunately, all too good. It has been said in physics no creator of any significant thing ever understood what he had done. I never found Einstein on the special relativity theory as clear as some later commentators. And at least one friend of mine has said, behind my back, &lsquo;Hamming doesn't seem to understand error correcting codes!&rsquo; He is probably right; I do not understand what I invented as clearly as he does. The reason this happens so often is the creators have to fight through so many dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is open and the path made easy. Please remember, the inventor often has a very limited view of what he invented, and some others (you?) can see much more. But also remember this when you are the author of some brilliant new thing; in time the same will probably be true of you. It has been said Newton was the last of the ancients and not the first of the moderns, though he was very significant in making our modern world.&rdquo;</p></dd>

Pauli happened to be passing through New York, and was prevailed upon to give a lecture explaining the new ideas to an audience which included Niels Bohr. Pauli spoke for an hour, and then there was a general discussion during which he was criticized rather sharply by the younger generation. Finally Bohr was called on to make a speech summing up the argument. &lsquo;We are all agreed,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.&rsquo; The objection that they are not crazy enough applies to all the attempts which have so far been launched at a radically new theory of elementary particles. It applies especially to crackpots. Most of the crackpot papers which are submitted to <i>The Physical Review</i> are rejected, not because it is impossible to understand them, but because it is possible. Those which are impossible to understand are usually published. When the great innovation appears, it will almost certainly be in a muddled, incomplete and confusing form. To the discoverer himself it will be only half-understood; to everybody else it will be a mystery. For any speculation which does not at first glance look crazy, there is no hope.&rdquo;</p></dd>

The task of the theorist is to bring order into the chaos of the phenomena of nature, to invent a language by which a class of these phenomena can be described efficiently and simply. Here is the place for &lsquo;intuition&rsquo;, and here the old preconception, common among natural philosophers, that natural is simple and elegant, has led to many great successes. Of course, physical theory must be based on experience, but experiment comes after, rather than before, theory.

<br /> This famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Reviews"><i>Mathematical Reviews</i></a> quotation by Truesdell appears in <i>Mathematical Reviews</i> 12, page 561. The review of a 1950 paper titled &ldquo;Equations of finite vibratory motions in isotropic elastic media&rdquo; reads:
&ldquo;This paper, whose intent is stated in its title, gives wrong solutions to trivial problems. The basic error, however, is not new: if the reviewer has correctly understood the author’s undefined notations and misprints, the stress-strain relations used are those once proposed by St.-Venant [J. Math. Pures Appl. (2) 8, 257&ndash;295, 353&ndash;430 (1863); see §2], whose incorrect confusion of coordinates in the deformed and undeformed states of the body was pointed out by Brill and Boussinesq [cf. St. Venant, ibid. (2) 16, 275&ndash;307 (1871), see §7]. The falsity of the author’s results is obvious, since for the speed of propagation of finite waves in isotropic bodies he obtains expressions which are not scalars unless the displacement gradients are infinitesimal.&rdquo; This quotation is recorded also in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Ball">J.

<dt>Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he learned in school.</dt>
<dd><p><br /> &mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a><br /> 
Einstein did write this quote in his essay &ldquo;On Education&rdquo; from 1936, which appeared as the 9th part of his book <i>Out of My Later Years</i> (Philosophical Library, New York, 1950). However, Einstein attributed it to an unnamed &ldquo;wit&rdquo;. He wrote that &ldquo;If you have followed attentively my meditations up to this point, you will probably wonder about one thing. I have spoken fully about in what spirit, according to my opinion, youth should be instructed. But I have said nothing yet about the choice of subjects for instruction, nor about the method of teaching. Should language predominate or technical education in science? To this I answer: In my opinion all this is of secondary importance. If a young man has trained his muscles and physical endurance by gymnastics and walking, he will later be fitted for every physical work. This is also analogous to the training of the mind and the exercising of the mental and manual skill. Thus the wit was not wrong who defined education in this way: &lsquo;<span class="dotunder">Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he learned in school.</span>&rsquo; For this reason I am not at all anxious to take sides in the struggle between the followers of the classical philologic-historical education and the education more devoted to natural science.&rdquo;<br />
This sentence is similar to the French saying &ldquo;La culture est ce qui reste lorsque l’on a tout oublié&rdquo; (Culture is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything), attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89douard_Herriot">Édouard Herriot</a>.
Another French variant is &ldquo;La culture est ce qui reste lorsqu'on a oublié toutes les choses apprises&rdquo; (Culture is that which remains if one has forgotten everything one has learned), which appears in the 1912 book <i>Propos Critiques</i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Duhamel">Georges Duhamel</a>.
