This page collects some quotes that I like. I try to clarify where 
the quotes originally came from. This page is updated from time to time. 
Most of the materials are from internet.

:{A large part of mathematics which becomes useful developed with
absolutely no desire to be useful, and in a situation where nobody could
possibly know in what area it would become useful; and there were no
general indications that it ever would be so.}\n ---

/The Role of Mathematics in the Sciences and in Society/,

[http://alumni.princeton.edu/communities/graduate/ Princeton Graduate Alumni]

:{If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because
they do not realize how complicated life is.}\n --- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann John von Neumann]\n 
This quote is apparently not from a published work of von Neumann's, 
but [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Alt Franz Leopold Alt] recalls it 
as a remark made from the podium by von Neumann as keynote speaker at the 
first national meeting of the 
[http://www.acm.org/ Association for Computing Machinery]
in 1947. 
The exchange at that meeting is described at the 
end

of Alt's brief article

Communications of the ACM, volume 15, issue 7, July 1972, 
special issue: Twenty-fifth anniversary of the 
Association for Computing Machinery], pages 693--694. 
Alt recalls that von Neumann said this quote when talking about the 
"new programming method" for

:{You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you will tell 
me precisely what it is that a machine cannot do, then I can always make 
a machine which will do just that!} \n --- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann John von Neumann]\n  
After giving a talk on computers at Princeton in 1948, John von Neumann 
was met with an audience member who insisted that a "mere machine" 
could never really think. Von Neumann's immortal reply was this, as quoted 
in Section 1.3

#-If one has really technically penetrated a subject, things that
#previously seemed in complete contrast, might be purely mathematical
#transformations of each other.
#--- John von Neumann
#
#-Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.
#Henri Poincaré.
#(This was in response to "Poetry is the art of giving different names to
#the same thing.")
#
#-The difference between mathematicians and physicists is that after
#physicists prove a big result they think it is fantastic but after
#mathematicians prove a big result they think it is trivial.
#Lucien Szpiro during Algebra 1 lecture.
#
#-Oh, he seems like an okay person, except for being a little strange in
#some ways. All day he sits at his desk and scribbles, scribbles,
#scribbles. Then, at the end of the day, he takes the sheets of paper
#he's scribbled on, scrunches them all up, and throws them in the trash
#can. --J. von Neumann's housekeeper, describing her employer.
#
#-You know, for a mathematician, he did not have enough imagination. But
#he has become a poet and now he is fine.
#
#D. Hilbert, talking about an ex-student.
#
#-The art of doing mathematics is finding that special case that contains
#all the germs of generality.
# --- David Hilbert
#
#- Everyone knows what a curve is, until he has studied enough mathematics
#to become confused through the countless number of possible exceptions.
#--- F. Klein (from Reed & Simon: Methods of modern mathematical physics)
#
#- A mathematician is a person who can find analogies between theorems;
#a better mathematician is one who can see analogies between proofs and
#the best mathematician can notice analogies between theories. One can
#imagine that the ultimate mathematician is one who can see analogies
#between analogies.
#
#--Stefan Banach
#
#- Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories. The
#very best ones see analogies between analogies.
#
#--Stanislaw M. Ulam quoting Stefan Banach
#
#- Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty
#-- a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to
#any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of
#painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection
#such as only the greatest art can show. The true spirit of delight, the
#exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of
#the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as
#poetry.
#Bertrand Russell, in Study of Mathematics, about the beauty of
#Mathematics.
#
#- If I feel unhappy, I do mathematics to become happy. If I am happy, I do
#mathematics to keep happy.
#------ Alfréd Rényi
#
#- "Obvious" is the most dangerous word in mathematics.
#
#- Anyone who cannot cope with mathematics is not fully human. At best he
#is a tolerable subhuman who has learned to wear shoes, bathe and not
#make messes in the house.
#Lazarus Long, "Time Enough for Love", (Robert A. Heinlein)
#
#- Since the mathematicians have invaded the theory of relativity, I do not
#understand it myself anymore. --Albert Einstein 
#
#- Mathematics may be defined as the subject in which we never know what we
#are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.
#Bertrand Russell, referring to the axiomatic method, where certain
#properties of an (otherwise unknown) structure are assumed and
#consequences thereof are then logically derived.
#
#- Do not worry about your problems with mathematics, I assure you mine are
#far greater. --- Albert Einstein 
#
#- Das Wesen der Mathematik ist ihre Freiheit. 
#--- Cantor
#
#- The simplest schoolboy is now familiar with facts for which Archimedes
#would have sacrificed his life. --Ernest Renan
#
#- If I have seen farther than others, it is because I have stood on the
#shoulders of giants.
#--Isaac Newton
#
#- If I have not seen as far as others, it is because there were giants
#standing on my shoulders.
#
#--Hal Abelson
#
#"Mathematicians are like Frenchmen: whatever you say
#     to them they translate into their own language and 
#          forthwith it is something entirely different."
#                -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
# 
# 10. "Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the 
#       individual who can labor in freedom."
#             -- Albert Einstein
#   26. "You know we all became mathematicians for the same reason: 
#         we were lazy."
#               -- Max Rosenlicht
#
# A mathematician is a device for turning coffee into theorems. – Alfréd
#Rényi  (- Paul Erdos? ) ... is only for lemma.
#
#"The difference between an introvert mathematician and an 
#      extrovert mathematicians is: An introvert mathematician looks 
#            at his shoes while talking to you. An extrovert
#            mathematician 
#                  looks at your shoes." 
#                  "Q.E.D. (Quod Erat Demonstrandum: Which was to be
#                  proven.)"
#                        -- Euclid
#           "Philosophy is a game with objectives and no rules. 
#                 Mathematics is a game with rules and no objectives."
# "When I am working on a problem, I never think about beauty.
#       I think only of how to solve the problem. But when I have
#             finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is
#             wrong." 
#                   -- Richard Buckminster Fuller 
#
# "Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place
#       in the world for ugly mathematics."
#             -- Godfrey Harold Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology (1940)
#
#"It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul."
#      -- Sophia Kovalevskaya
#      "A mathematician who is not also something of a poet will
#            never be a complete mathematician."
#                  -- Karl Weierstrass.
#                  "Math is like love -- a simple idea but it can get
#                  complicated."
#          
#          Mathematics is made of 50 percent formulas, 50 percent
#          proofs, and 50 percent imagination.
