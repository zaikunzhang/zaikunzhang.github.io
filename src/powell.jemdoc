== Professor Powell's publications

- There is a [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=p3kDmy0AAAAJ&authuser=1 page of Professor Powell] on Google Scholar Citations. I hope it is useful for those who would like to have an overview of Professor Powell's work. 

- If you are looking for Professor Powell's 1967 paper "A method for nonlinear constraints in minimization problems", you may send me an email (zaikunzhang \[&\] gmail.com). This influential paper seems not available on internet. I made a photocopy of the paper but cannot archive it here due to copyright issues. 

== Professor Powell's software

During his last days, Professor Powell kindly sent me the source code of his [software.html\#powell_software optimization software] and authorized me to maintain it
on the [software.html Software] page. 
Now the software is also maintained at [https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/powell CCPForge] by Professor [http://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/people/nimg/ Nick Gould] and me. Please feel free to {{<a href="mailto:nick.gould@stfc.ac.uk,zaikunzhang@gmail.com?subject=MJD Powell Software Technical Question">contact us</a>}} in case of any questions on the software, including its usage, its code, and its algorithms. Plans are underway to provide MATLAB, Python, and (possibly) C interfaces.
