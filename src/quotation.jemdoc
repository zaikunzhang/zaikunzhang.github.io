:{Cum enim mundi universi fabrica sit perfectissima atque a Creatore sapientissimo absoluta, nihil omnino in mundo contingit, in quo non maximi minimive ratio quaepiam eluceat; quamobrem dubium prorsus est nullum, quin omnes mundi effectus ex causis finalibus ope methodi maximorum & minimorum aeque feliciter determinari queant, atque ex ipsis causis efficientibus. (For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect, and is the work of a most wise Creator, nothing whatsoever takes place in the universe in which some relation of maximum and minimum does not appear. Wherefore there is absolutely no doubt that every effect in the universe can be explained as satisfactorily from final causes, by the aid of the method of maxima and minima, as it can from the effective causes themselves.)} \n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler Leonhard Euler]\n

:{A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.}
\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfr%C3%A9d_R%C3%A9nyi Alfréd Rényi]
\n This remark, generally attributed to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s Paul Erdős], was probably made by Alfréd Rényi. 
In [https://plus.google.com/110050584459359486755 Bruce Schechter]'s biography of Erdős, /[https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/My_Brain_is_Open.html?id=_GsQiXvfNWkC&redir_esc=y My Brain is Open: The Mathematical Journeys of Paul Erdős]/ (Simon and Schuster, 1998), [https://goo.gl/Gimxso page 155] reads:
"Rényi would become one of Erdős's most important collaborators ... Their long collaborative sessions were often fueled by endless cups of strong coffee. Caffeine is the drug of choice for most of the world's mathematicians and coffee is the preferred delivery system. Rényi, undoubtedly wired on espresso, summed this up in a famous remark almost always attributed to Erdős: `A mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems.' ... {{<span class="dotunder">}}Turán ([https://goo.gl/XVcpRW Pál Turán]), after scornfully drinking a cup of American coffee, invented the corollary: `Weak coffee is only fit for lemmas.{{</span>}}'" Similar attribution is given in /[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacTutor_History_of_Mathematics_archive MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive]: [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Renyi.html Alfréd Rényi]/, where it is written that "Known to his many friends and colleagues by the nickname of 'Buba', he (Rényi) often remembered as the author of the anecdote: ... a mathematician is a machine for converting coffee into theorems. Turán developed the anecdote further by describing weak coffee as fit only for lemmas." Additionally, in [http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-networks6 Section 6] (The Erdős graph) of the essay "Complex Networks" ([http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcbrowse?year=2004 Feature Column from the AMS, April 2004]), [http://www.york.cuny.edu/~malk/ Joseph Malkevitch] writes: "Erdős has often been associated with the observation that `a mathematician is a machine for converting coffee into theorems' but this `characterization' appears to be due to his friend, Alfred Rényi. This thought was developed further by Erdős' friend the Hungarian mathematician Paul Turán (1910--1976), who suggested that weak coffee was suitable `only for lemmas'." 
#The same was written in page 731 of [https://books.google.com.hk/books/about/A_History_of_Mathematics.html?id=sT8gAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y /A History of Mathematics/] (Prentice Hall, 2002) by [https://sites.google.com/site/jeffsuzukiproject/ Jeff Suzuki]: "The first main result was by the Hungarian mathematician Alfred Renyi (March 20, 1921--February 1, 1970), who is best known for a saying of his: a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems."

\n However, it is also suggested that this sentence was originally formulated in German: "Ein Mathematiker ist eine Maschine, die Kaffee in Sätze verwandelt", where it can be interpreted as a wordplay on the double meaning of the word "[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/german-english/satz Satz]", which can mean both "theorem" and "coffee grounds" ("Sätze" is its plural form).

:{The true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be in a reasonable man's mind).

\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell James C. Maxwell] 
\n This quotation comes from "Letter to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Campbell_(classicist) Lewis Campbell], c. July 1850", [http://books.google.fr/books/about/The_Scientific_Letters_and_Papers_of_Jam.html?id=zfM8AAAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y /The Scientific Letters and Papers of James Clerk Maxwell: 1846--1862/], edited by Peter M. Harman, CUP Archive, 1990 ([http://goo.gl/AkFGIo page 197]).
It was written in this letter that "As it is Saturday night I will not write very much more. I was thinking today of the duties of \[the\] cognitive faculty. It is universally admitted that duties are voluntary, and that the will governs understanding by giving or withholding Attention. They say that Understanding ought to work by the rules of right reason. These rules are, or ought to be, contained in Logic; but the actual science of Logic is conversant at present on with things either certain, impossible, or /entirely/ doubtful, none of which (fortunately) we have to reason on. Therefore the true Logic for this world is the Calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability (which is, or which ought to be in a reasonable man's mind). This branch of Math., which is generally thought to favour gambling, dicing, and wagering, and therefore highly immoral, is the only `Mathematics for Practical Men', as we ought to be. Now, as human knowledge comes by the senses in such a way that the existence of things external is on inferred from the harmonious (not similar) testimony of the different senses, Understanding, acting by the laws of right reasoning, will assign to different truths (or facts, or testimonies, or what shall I call them) different degrees of probability."

"Thus whether one chooses to say that classical mechanics is causal or
teleological is purely a matter of literary inclination at the moment of
talking. This is very important, since it proves, that if one has really
technically penetrated a subject, things that previously seemed in
complete contrast, might be purely mathematical transformations of each
other. Things which appear to represent deep differences of principle and
of interpretation, in this way may turn out not to affect any significant
statements and any predictions. They mean nothing to the content of the
theory."

\n Similar comments appear in Richard W. Hamming, [https://goo.gl/bQDpH9 /The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn/], CRC Press, 2003 (Chapter 4, pages 27--28): 
"History tends to be charitable in this matter. It gives credit for understanding what something means when we first to do it. But there is a wise saying, `Almost everyone who opens up a new field does not really understand it the way the followers do.' The evidence for this is, unfortunately, all too good. It has been said in physics no creator of any significant thing ever understood what he had done. I never found Einstein on the special relativity theory as clear as some later commentators. And at least one friend of mine has said, behind my back, `Hamming doesn't seem to understand error correcting codes!' He is probably right; I do not understand what I invented as clearly as he does. The reason this happens so often is the creators have to fight through so many dark difficulties, and wade through so much misunderstanding and confusion, they cannot see the light as others can, now the door is open and the path made easy. Please remember, the inventor often has a very limited view of what he invented, and some others (you?) can see much more. But also remember this when you are the author of some brilliant new thing; in time the same will probably be true of you. It has been said Newton was the last of the ancients and not the first of the moderns, though he was very significant in making our modern world."

:{When theory becomes inbred ---  when it has grown several generations away from its roots, until it has completely lost touch with the real world --- it degenerates and becomes sterile.}

#I think that it is a relatively good approximation to truth - which is
#much too complicated to allow anything but approximations-that
#mathematical ideas originate in empirics, although the genealogy is
#sometimes long and obscure. But, once they are so conceived, the
#subject begins to live a peculiar life of its own and is better
#compared to a creative one, governed by almost entirely aesthetical
#motivations, than to anything else and, in particular, to an empirical
#science. There is, however, a further point which, I believe, needs
#stressing. As a mathematical discipline travels far from its empirical
#source, or still more, if it is a second and third generation only
#indirectly inspired by ideas coming from "reality" it is beset with
#very grave dangers. It becomes more and more purely aestheticizing,
#more and more purely I'art pour I'art. This need not be bad, if the
#field is surrounded by correlated subjects, which still have closer
#empirical connections, or if the discipline is under the influence of
#men with an exceptionally well-developed taste. But there is a grave
#danger that the subject will develop along the line of least
#resistance, that the stream, so far from its source, will separate into
#a multitude of insignificant branches, and that the discipline will
#become a disorganized mass of details and complexities. In other words,
#at a great distance from its empirical source, or after much "abstract"
#inbreeding, a mathematical subject is in danger of degeneration. At the
#inception the style is usually classical; when it shows signs of
#becoming baroque, then the danger signal is up. It would be easy to
#give examples, to trace specific evolutions into the baroque and the
#very high baroque, but this, again, would be too technical.
#
#In any event, whenever this stage is reached, the only remedy seems to
#me to be the rejuvenating return to the source: the re-injection of
#more or less directly empirical ideas. I am convinced that this was
#a necessary condition to conserve the freshness and the vitality of the
#subject and that this will remain equally true in the future.

Pauli happened to be passing through New York, and was prevailed upon to give a lecture explaining the new ideas to an audience which included Niels Bohr. Pauli spoke for an hour, and then there was a general discussion during which he was criticized rather sharply by the younger generation. Finally Bohr was called on to make a speech summing up the argument. `We are all agreed,' he said, `that your theory is crazy. The question which divides us is whether it is crazy enough to have a chance of being correct. My own feeling is that it is not crazy enough.' The objection that they are not crazy enough applies to all the attempts which have so far been launched at a radically new theory of elementary particles. It applies especially to crackpots. Most of the crackpot papers which are submitted to /The Physical Review/ are rejected, not because it is impossible to understand them, but because it is possible. Those which are impossible to understand are usually published. When the great innovation appears, it will almost certainly be in a muddled, incomplete and confusing form. To the discoverer himself it will be only half-understood; to everybody else it will be a mystery. For any speculation which does not at first glance look crazy, there is no hope."

The task of the theorist is to bring order into the chaos of the phenomena of nature, to invent a language by which a class of these phenomena can be described efficiently and simply. Here is the place for `intuition', and here the old preconception, common among natural philosophers, that natural is simple and elegant, has led to many great successes. Of course, physical theory must be based on experience, but experiment comes after, rather than before, theory. Without theoretical concepts one would neither know what experiments to perform nor be able to interpret their outcome."

: {This paper, whose intent is stated in its title, gives wrong solutions to trivial problems. The basic error, however, is not new.}
\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Truesdell Clifford A. Truesdell]
\n This famous [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Reviews /Mathematical Reviews/] quotation by Truesdell appears in /Mathematical Reviews/ 12, page 561. The review of a 1950 paper titled "Equations of finite vibratory motions in isotropic elastic media" reads:
"This paper, whose intent is stated in its title, gives wrong solutions to trivial problems. The basic error, however, is not new: if the reviewer has correctly understood the author’s undefined notations and misprints, the stress-strain relations used are those once proposed by St.-Venant \[J. Math. Pures Appl. (2) 8, 257--295, 353--430 (1863); see §2\], whose incorrect confusion of coordinates in the deformed and undeformed states of the body was pointed out by Brill and Boussinesq \[cf. St. Venant, ibid. (2) 16, 275--307 (1871), see §7\]. The falsity of the author’s results is obvious, since for the speed of propagation of finite waves in isotropic bodies he obtains expressions which are not scalars unless the displacement gradients are infinitesimal."

:{Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he learned in school.}\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein Albert Einstein]\n 
Einstein did write this quote in his essay "On Education" from 1936, which appeared as the 9th part of his book /Out of My Later Years/ (Philosophical Library, New York, 1950). However, Einstein attributed it to an unnamed "wit". He wrote that "If you have followed attentively my meditations up to this point, you will probably wonder about one thing. I have spoken fully about in what spirit, according to my opinion, youth should be instructed. But I have said nothing yet about the choice of subjects for instruction, nor about the method of teaching. Should language predominate or technical education in science? To this I answer: In my opinion all this is of secondary importance. If a young man has trained his muscles and physical endurance by gymnastics and walking, he will later be fitted for every physical work. This is also analogous to the training of the mind and the exercising of the mental and manual skill. Thus the wit was not wrong who defined education in this way: `{{<span class="dotunder">}}Education is that which remains, if one has forgotten everything he learned in school.{{</span>}}' For this reason I am not at all anxious to take sides in the struggle between the followers of the classical philologic-historical education and the education more devoted to natural science."\n

#Another English variant is "Culture is that which remains with a man when he has forgotten all he has learned" which appears in The Living Age: Volume 335 from 1929, p. 159, where it is attributed to "Edouard Herriot, French Minister of Education". Another English variant is "Education is that which remains behind when all we have learned at school is forgotten", which appears in The Education Outlook, vol. 60 p. 532 (from an issue dated 2 December 1907), where it is attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson.

语出陈寅恪为清华 [figs/wangxiansheng.jpg "海宁王静安先生纪念碑"] 所撰碑文[figs/duliziyou.jpg 《海宁王先生之碑铭》]："[https://goo.gl/pFeOvS 海宁王先生]自沉后二年，清华研究院同人咸怀思不能自已。其弟子受先生之陶冶煦育者有年，尤思有以永其念，佥曰：宜铭之贞珉，以昭示于无竟。因以刻石之辞命寅恪，数辞不获已，谨举先生之志事，以普告天下后世。其词曰：士之读书治学，盖将以脱心志于俗谛之桎梏，真理因得以发扬。思想而不自由，毋宁死耳。斯古今仁圣所同殉之精义，夫岂庸鄙之敢望。先生以一死见其独立自由之意志，非所论于一人之恩怨，一姓之兴亡。呜呼！树兹石于讲舍，系哀思而不忘。表哲人之奇节，诉真宰之茫茫。来世不可知者也，先生之著述，或有时而不章，先生之学说，或有时而可商。惟此独立之精神，自由之思想，历千万祀，与天壤而同久，共三光而永光。"

:{Give me liberty or give me death! ([https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivre_libre_ou_mourir Vivre libre ou mourir] !)}\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry Patrick Henry] \n
This quotation is attributed to Patrick Henry from [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/patrick.asp the famous speech] he made to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Conventions The Second Virginia Convention] on Mar. 23, 1775, at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_Episcopal_Church_(Richmond,_Virginia) St. John's Episcopal Church] in Richmond, Virginia. Closing his speech, Patrick Henry exclaimed "It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace --- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!"

:{Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here.}\n --- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan Christopher Nolan] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Nolan Jonathan Nolan]
\n This quotation comes from the 2014 movie [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film) /Interstellar/], the director being Christopher Nolan, and the script writer being Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan. It is similar to the sentence [http://web.archive.org/web/20060421175318/http://www.uranos.eu.org/biogr/ciolke.html "Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot live in a cradle forever."] (Планета есть колыбель разума, но нельзя вечно жить в колыбели, more precisely translated as "The planet is the cradle of the mind, but you cannot live forever in the cradle"), which was written by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Tsiolkovsky Konstantin E.

\n The quotation resembles a fact about mathematics: Mathematics starts from intuition, but it is never meant to stay there; /ou/: Good mathematicians start from intuition (and most likely return there in the end), while lousy ones stay there (without ever leaving). To see what it means, read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao Terence Tao]'s essay on the three stages of mathematical education ("[https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/there’s-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/ There’s more to mathematics than rigour and proofs]") and the [\#zen quotation on the three stages of Zen].
