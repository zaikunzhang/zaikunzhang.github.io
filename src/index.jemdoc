-- Z. Zhang, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04536 Scalable Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithms with
Low-Dimensional Subspace Techniques], arXiv:2501.04536, 2025 \[[docs/publications/2025subspace.pdf pdf]\]
\nRemark: This paper re-introduces a derivative-free subspace optimization framework originating from Chapter
5 of my Ph.D. thesis supervised by Prof. [http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx Ya-xiang Yuan]
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
An algorithm following this framework was implemented by me in MATLAB in 2011 under the name NEWUOAs, which
became the basis of [https://github.com/modula3/cm3/blob/master/caltech-other/newuoa/src/NewUOAs.m3 the
NEWUOAs code used at the Intel Corporation] for chip design;
it also led to the [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10247570 BBGP-sDFO] method for high-dimensional analog circuit synthesis.
The framework remained nearly unknown to the community until very recently, although it
was presented at [docs/conferences/201307-iccopt.pdf ICCOPT 2013] in Lisbon under the title
"[docs/talks/20130729-iccopt-lstlsp.pdf A Derivative-Free Optimization Algorithm with Low-Dimensional Subspace
Techniques for Large-Scale Problems]" as the second talk of Session Mon.A.15 Chaired by J. Larson on
July 29, 2013, which happened to be the birthday of [powell.html the late Professor M. J. D. Powell FRS].

   \nRemark: NEWUOAs was developed in 2011 when I was writing Chapter 5 of my [docs/publications/thesis.pdf thesis];
   my MATLAB code written then was ported to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-3 Modula-3]
   in 2016 by [https://github.com/mikanystrom-intel M. Nystroem], a Principle Engineer at the Intel
   Corporation, and made available in the open-source package
   [https://github.com/modula3/cm3/blob/master/caltech-other/newuoa/src/NewUOAs.m3 CM3].
   It has been used by Intel in the design of chips, including its flagship product
