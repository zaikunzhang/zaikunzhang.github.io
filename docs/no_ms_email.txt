Dear Sir or Madam,

You receive this email probably because you have sent me an email that
includes a Microsoft file (doc, xls, ppt, etc.). Thank you very much for
sending your document. I am very interested in its content. Unfortunately, 
my computer is not able to process Microsoft files. I would be grateful 
if you could kindly resend your document in plain text or pdf. Then I will 
read it.

For more information, see https://logological.org/word

Please do not reply this email.

Many thanks.

Yours faithfully,
Zaikun
